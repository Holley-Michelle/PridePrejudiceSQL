# üìñ Pride and Prejudice and SQL

Welcome to **Pride and Prejudice and SQL**, a whimsical and educational SQL project that brings Jane Austen‚Äôs literary masterpiece to life through structured data! This project is designed for those learning SQL basics ‚Äî from database creation and data modeling to queries and joins ‚Äî using fictional but thoughtfully crafted data from *Pride and Prejudice*.

---

## üìä Project Overview

This SQL script walks learners through a multi-lesson exercise using a custom database. It includes:

- **Lesson 1**: Create and populate tables with character demographics, household details, financial information, and plot points.
- **Lesson 2**: Alter tables and add new data to simulate character arcs and life events.
- **Lesson 3**: Practice SQL joins (including `LEFT JOIN` and `GROUP BY`) to analyze relationships between characters and their life events.
- **Lesson 4**: Write custom queries to answer questions like:
  - Who lives at Netherfield?
  - Who are the wealthiest characters?
- **Extra Practice**: Create a view (`character_summary`) for reusability and efficient querying.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

The project contains **four primary tables** and **one supplementary table**:

| Table Name             | Description                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `character_demographics` | Character details including age, gender, birth date, and ending marital status |
| `household_details`     | Named locations (e.g., Longbourn, Pemberley)       |
| `income_or_dowry`       | Character wealth information linked to households  |
| `narrative_parts`       | Major plot points in the story                     |
| `life_events`           | Post-narrative life details (e.g., spouse, moves)  |

## üîç Sample Queries

```sql
-- Characters who lived at Netherfield
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM character_demographics c
JOIN income_or_dowry i ON c.story_id = i.story_id
JOIN household_details h ON i.household_id = h.household_id
WHERE h.household_name = 'Netherfield';

-- Top 3 wealthiest characters
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, i.income_or_dowry_amount
FROM income_or_dowry i
JOIN character_demographics c ON i.story_id = c.story_id
ORDER BY i.income_or_dowry_amount DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

## üß† Educational Features

- AI-assisted birthdates and marital outcomes enhance realism.
- Inline comments explain best practices and SQL reasoning.
- Demonstrates usage of `ALTER TABLE`, `CASE WHEN`, `FOREIGN KEY`, and views.
- Great for classroom or portfolio use.

## üõ† How to Use

1. Run the full script in a MySQL-compatible environment.
2. Skip the `DROP DATABASE` line if you‚Äôre initializing for the first time.
3. Explore and adapt the queries for practice or visualization projects.
